This paper investigates the use of a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting intelligent reflecting surface (STAR-IRS) to enhance rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems in 6G communications. STAR-IRS can transmit and reflect signals concurrently, improving spectral efficiency and expanding coverage. The study addresses performance in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI), a critical aspect not fully explored in prior research. Analytical expressions for outage probability and sum rate are derived, and an automatic optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to maximize weighted sum rate (WSR) under imperfect CSI. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived expressions and demonstrate that the AO algorithm significantly improves WSR performance in STAR-IRS-based RSMA systems with imperfect CSI.
